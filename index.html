        <h2 class="about"> About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Dez, I am studying to become a Software Engineer. Currently I live in Arizona. My partner and I have 2 kiddos and 3 cats. When it is too hot to be outside, I am usually playign vidoe games, making art, reading, or watching random shows and documentaries. When the sun isn't trying to cook me, I enjoy spending most of my time outside playing soccer, hiking, and exploring nature. I love cooking and when I have the time I like to make special meals for family and friends.</p>
    
        <h2 class="goal">Future Goal</h2>
        <p>My goal is to become a Software Engineer working on video games and/or apps. I really enjoy learing how to create programs and seeing the finished product. I have always loved games and I am facinated by how they work. I have dabbled in codding in the past and I have realized it brings me joy to create a little game or even help a friend with a website. </p>
